1. The Computer
  - Turing machines
  - von Newman architecture
  
2. Programming languages
  - Recursion

3. Algorithms
  - Divide and conquer (I do not know in which section to put this idea, but it is an idea that is repeated in computer science, from a strategy in an algorithm to a good hierarchy of classes where responsibilities are assigned to each of the objects to solve specific subproblems and together form a solution to the problem initially posed.)
