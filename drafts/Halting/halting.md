# The Math Crisis and the Halting Problem


## Main Point
Formality and rigour have always had a place in math: Alan Turing, Euclid, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, …

## Main Point
Intuitive explanations for the notions of axioms, theorems, and proofs

  ## Sub-Points
**Axioms:** Axioms originated from the greek word _"Axioma"_ which means  _"To deem worthy"_. In simple words, axioms are the starting point for any Logical theory or argument, that is, 	they are those universal basic truths everyone agrees on and no one argues about, for example, the _[axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice)_ which simply states that 
for every collection of sets, one can create a new set using elements from each set in the original collection.

**Theorems:** A theorem is simply a mathematical statement that has been proven or is being proven through deductive reasoning. They provide the basis for the development of mathematical theory. A mathematical theorem everyone is no doubt familiar with is _[Pythagoras Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) (C^2 = A^2+B^2)_. It should be noted that, although, used interchnageably, in a mathematical context, the words theory and theorem do not mean the same thing. In short, a theory is the comprehensive explanation of a subject or phenomena, while, a theorem is a proven mathematical statement. 

**Proofs:** In non-esoteric words, proofs are logical propsitions and arguments which prove the validity of a mathematial statement. Proofs begin from axioms and then proceed to a series of logical extrapolations/deductions, and then an end in the statement being proven(the end of every proof is called a thereom). 

Proofs are generally made to prove the logical soundness of a mathematical statement. Here is a basic example of a statement and its resulting proof:**Prove that an integer N that is not divisible by 3 cannot be divisible by 9**, this is basic example of something called a [Contrapositive Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contrapositive), and to prove our statement, we will simply say  **"if n is not divisible by 3, then n is not divisible by 9," we will prove the equivalent statement "if n is divisible by 9, then n is divisible by 3."**

## Main Point

First-order logic was mostly developed by the end of the 19th century, including set theory (with Cantor) and its weird ideas about infinity

## Main Point

Hilbert’s dream of axiomatizing all mathematics and solving all important problems, including problem No 7 (Diophantine equations) which will be relevant to Computer Science later on

## Main Point

Russell discovers insidious logical statements that undermine the notion that all human thought can be axiomatized in a formal system  

## Main Point

Hilbert posses the Entscheidungs problem

## Main Point

Godel proves that first-order logic is complete and consistent, but obliterates the dream of proving all math complete and consistent
