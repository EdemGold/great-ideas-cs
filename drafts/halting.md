# The Math Crisis and the Halting Problem

## Main points

- Formality and rigour have always had a place in math: Euclid, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, …
- Intuitive explanations for the notions of axioms, theorems, and proofs
- First-order logic was mostly developed by the end of the 19th century, including set theory (with Cantor) and its weird ideas about infinity
- Hilbert’s dream of axiomatizing all mathematics and solving all important problems, including problem No 7 (Diophantine equations) which will be relevant to Computer Science later on
- Russell discovers insidious logical statements that undermine the notion that all human thought can be axiomatized in a formal system
- Hilbert posses the Entscheidungsproblem
- Godel proves that first-order logic is complete and consistent, but obliterates the dream of proving all math complete and consistent
