# The Math Crisis and the Halting Problem

## Main Point
Formality and rigour have always had a place in math: Alan Turing, Euclid, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, …

## Main Point
Intuitive explanations for the notions of axioms, theorems, and proofs
  
  ## Sub-Points
**Axioms:** Axioms originated from the greek word _"Axioma"_ which means  _"To deem worthy"_ In simple words, axioms are the starting point for any Logical theory or argument, that is, 	they are those universal basic truths everyone agrees on and no one argues about, for example; 	_the sun rises in the east, all planets revolve around the sun, Parallel lines never intersect, etc_. 

**Theorems:** A theorem is simply a mathematical statement that has been proven or is being proven through deductive reasoning. They provide the basis for the development of mathematical theory. A mathematical theorem everyone is no doubt familiar with is _[Pythagoras Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) (C^2 = A^2+B^2)_. It should be noted that, although, used interchnageably, in a mathematical context, the words theory and theorem do not mean the same thing. In short, a theory is the comprehensive explanation of a subject or phenomena, while, a theorem is a proven mathematical statement. 

**Proofs:** In non-esoteric words, proofs are logical propsitions and arguments which prove the valiity of a mathematial statement. Proofs begin from axioms and then proceed to a series of logical extrapolations/deductions, and then end in the statement being proven. Proofs are generally made to prove the logical soundness of a mathematical statement.  The word proof comes from the latin word _"probare"_ which means _"to test_, in it's most basic definition, a proof is a series of deductions which originate from axioms to prove and validate a paricular mathematical statemnt. 
  
## Main Point
  
First-order logic was mostly developed by the end of the 19th century, including set theory (with Cantor) and its weird ideas about infinity

## Main Point

Hilbert’s dream of axiomatizing all mathematics and solving all important problems, including problem No 7 (Diophantine equations) which will be relevant to Computer Science later on

## Main Point

Russell discovers insidious logical statements that undermine the notion that all human thought can be axiomatized in a formal system  

## Main Point

Hilbert posses the Entscheidungs problem

## Main Point

Godel proves that first-order logic is complete and consistent, but obliterates the dream of proving all math complete and consistent
